# Spoon maven plugin

A maven plugin to run spoon on a target project.

## Usage

To execute Spoon maven plugin, you must declare it on the build tag in the `pom.xml` file of your project and specify an execution during the `generate-source` phase of the maven lifecycle.

The usage below is the minimum to execute the plugin and run spoon on your project.

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>fr.inria.gforge.spoon</groupId>
    <artifactId>spoon-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${plugin.spoon.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

After that, you can launch the command `mvn clean install` and the plugin will be automatically called.

## Inputs

You can configure some parameters in the plugin in the configuration tag of your plugin declaration:

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>fr.inria.gforge.spoon</groupId>
    <artifactId>spoon-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${plugin.spoon.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Your configuration -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Source and output folder

You can specify at spoon its input and output directories with, respectively, `srcFolder` and `outFolder` tags.

### Formatting

You can preserving the formatting of your source code with the boolean tag `preserveFormatting`.

### Processors

Spoon can use processors to process some codes during its analysis of a source code. The plugin supports processors and can be specified as configuration in the declaration of the plugin.

> **Warning:** For each processor specified, you must specify a jar who contains the processor compiled.

In the next usage, we would like to launch the processor name `fr.inria.gforge.spoon.processors.CountStatementProcessor` (you must specify the full qualified name) and its compiled class in the jar file `/Users/you/.m2/repository/fr/inria/gforge/spoon/spoon-processors/1.0-SNAPSHOT/spoon-processors-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (you must specify the path absolute).

```
<configuration>
    <processors>
        <processor>fr.inria.gforge.spoon.processors.CountStatementProcessor</processor>
    </processors>
    <jarFiles>
        <jarFile>/Users/you/.m2/repository/fr/inria/gforge/spoon/spoon-processors/1.0-SNAPSHOT/spoon-processors-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</jarFile>
    </jarFiles>
</configuration>
```

## Reports

The plugin creates some reports about its context and the execution of spoon on your project. These reports are available according to your definition of the plugin.

- If you have a simple project, you can retrieve the report at this location: `target/spoon-maven-plugin/result-spoon.xml`.
- If you have a multi-module project, you can retrieve on each sub module at the some location: `target/spoon-maven-plugin/result-spoon.xml`.
- If you have a multi-module project but you didn't declared your plugin at the root `pom.xml` file, you can retrieve the report on each sub module from your declaration.
